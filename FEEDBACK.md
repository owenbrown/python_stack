CoderDojo is great, let's make it better
## [Installation](http://learn.village88.com/m/19/177/1914) doesn't need brew.
It's simpler for new people to simply [download from Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
## Python3.5 and above don't require installing virtualenv
Instead do `python3 -m venv my_virtual_environment`
